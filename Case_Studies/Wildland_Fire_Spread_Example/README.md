# Wildfire Spread Example

This directory contains the files needed to create an FDS input file that performs a fire spread simulation over mountainous terrain. You can either run the FDS input files that have already been generated, located in the `FDS_Files` folder, or you can run QGIS and the script qgis2fds, the files for which are located in `QGIS_Files`.
