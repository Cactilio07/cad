# Askervein Hill Geometry Workflow

This README documents the workflow for generating the Askervein Hill geometry for FDS.

The resulting binary file `Askervein_5m.bingeom`, which represents terrain at 5 m resolution, is used by the input files in `fds/Validation/Askervein_Hill/FDS_Input_Files/*.fds`.

Thanks to Javier Sanz Rodrigo of the [Windbench](https://windbench.net/askervein-neutral) project for providing the topology data in .map format.

The file `Askervein_Neutral_elevation-roughness.map` was opened with the [wasp](https://www.wasp.dk/dataandtools#map-editor) map editor and exported as .dxf height curves. This .dxf was loaded in [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) and cropped to a section of about 6 km by 6 km around Askervein Hill conatining all needed reference points from the [Askervein 1983](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gb21m8G6irryDDNEoKsXwXBETwlGnccK/view?usp=sharing) report. The resulting vector topography was exported to `Askervein_vertices.dxf`. The Matlab script `terrain_dxf2geom.m` was used to load `Askervein_vertices.dxf` and interpolate the terrain geom with desired resolution.

The Matlab .dxf reader script [f_LectDxf.m](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24572-read-dxf-file-data) (required by `terrain_dxf2geom.m`) was downloaded from Matlab Central (see license within the script).

The next step was to run FDS using a CATF line to inlude the GEOM lines generated by `terrain_dxf2geom.m`.  This run generates a binary geom file (extension `.bingeom`), which is then saved in this `cad` repo under the name `Askervein_5m.bingeom` and referenced in the commited input files for Askervein Hill in the `fds` repo.
